Documentation on Different Python modules to develope Voice Assistant.


In a Voice Assistant Speech recognition is the process of converting audio into text.
This is commonly used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.
Python provides an API called SpeechRecognition to allow us to convert audio into text for further processing.
There are few modules that we need to develope a oice assistant :- 1) Subprocess 2) wolframalfa 3) pyttsx3 4) wikipedia 5)SpeechRecognition 6) Tkinter 7) web browser 8) dateTime

1) Subprocess : This module is used for getting system subprocess details which are used in various commands i.e Shutdown, Sleep, etc. This module comes buit-in with Python. 
2) Wolframalpha : It is used to compute expert-level answers using Wolfram’s algorithms, knowledgebase and AI technology. 
3) pyttsx3 : This module is used for conversion of text to speech in a program it works offline.
4) wikipedia : As we all know Wikipedia is a great source of knowledge just like GeeksforGeeks we have used Wikipedia module to get information from Wikipedia or to perform Wikipedia search. 
5) Speech Recognition : Since we’re building an Application of voice assistant, one of the most important things in this is that your assistant recognizes your voice (means what you want to say/ ask). 
6) Tkinter : his module is used for building GUI and comes inbuit with Python. This module comes buit-in with Python. 
7) Web browser : To perform Web Search. This module comes buit-in with Python.

Installation of Modules:
pip install wolframaplha
pip install wikipedia
pip install pyttsx3
pip install SpeechRecognition
